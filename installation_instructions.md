#Running Python
\
\
Before you can run, you must first walk (or slither).  In order to get Python to run on your machine, you need to either download it directly or run it through an intermediary.  There are many different ways to do this.  We will highlight three possibilities, but for those that prefer another method, RealPython has compiled a broader list.  Be aware that one has a limited number of ‘reads’ before the RealPython website requests you make an account with them.  You can get around this issue by opening a ‘private browsing’ tab and reading it there. The abovementioned guide can be found here : https://realpython.com/installing-python/

###Method 1: Installing Python and Jupyter Notebooks
\
The first of the three options we would like to highlight is installing Python and Jupyter Notebooks.  This installs the software directly on to your computer.  It is slightly technical, as you will have to initiate the program through your computer's terminal/powershell, but once running it is far less finicky than the other options with respect to uploading or downloading files that you might use in your coding.  A detailed set of instructions for both Mac and PC users can be found further down this page.

###Method 2: Google Colab
\
Google Colab, along with ERDA, is perhaps the easiest of these three options to get up and running, as all it requires is a Google account (i.e. a Gmail login).  After you login, you simply create a new notebook and start coding.  Uploading and downloading files can be finicky on this medium, as they need to be uploaded again for each coding session in the free version.  All uploaded files are erased when you close your session or if your session times out.  You can read more about Google Colab at this link:

###Method 3: CUs ERDA
\
Copenhagen University provides its students and staff with access to its Electronic Research Data Archive (ERDA).  ERDA includes a built-in copy of Jupyter Notebooks, which runs the newest version of Python.  Simply select the Jupyter Notebooks icon after logging in, then select Start DAG, and continue on to your coding space.  Be aware that ERDA cannot read local files off of your computer so you must, like Google Colab, upload any files you wish to work with.  Unlike Google Colab, however, ERDA will maintain your files over time, saving you the trouble of worrying about different file pathways in your code.
