## How to Install Python on macOS
Python 2 comes preinstalled on older versions of macOS. This is no longer the case for current versions of macOS, [starting with macOS Catalina](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-catalina-10_15-release-notes#Scripting-Language-Runtimes).

### How to Check Your Python Version on a Mac

2. Type `Terminal`.
3. Press Enter.
